# Mobile-Applications
 
This folder contains various subfolders each of which is the code of a mobile application built in react-native using expo CLI.
 
The application "employeesRecord" is a full-stack mobile application whose front-end is built using react-native and back-end is built using NodeJS/ExpressJs with MongoDB as the database. Employees-Record is a complete application with user authentication integrated within it. It contains google and facebook user authentication along with its local user authentication. In case of local authentication, if a user forgets his/her password then he/she can reset the password using "forgot password" functionality which proceeds through user e-mail verification.

The other apps dispalyWeather, lovePercentageCalculator, todoApp are just front-end applications, however, fetching some data from already built API's.
